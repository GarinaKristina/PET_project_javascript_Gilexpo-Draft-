# Jenkins Skills Development Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my Jenkins repository! Here lies a testament to my journey mastering Jenkins.

## Pipeline Overview
This repository's Jenkins pipeline is configured to handle multiple stages that ensure code quality and smooth deployment. From cleaning workspaces to running tests and generating reports, each stage is carefully crafted to enhance the software delivery process.

## Technologies and Tools
- **Jenkins Pipelines:** Utilizes Jenkinsfile to define multi-stage CI/CD pipelines.
- **Git:** For cloning and managing versions of the mobile application repository.
- **Node.js and npm:** Handles package installations and running JavaScript tests.
- **Allure Reports:** Integrates Allure framework for generating test reports.
- **Email-Ext Plugin:** Configured to send detailed notifications with test results and reports.

## Automated Processes
The pipeline automates the following tasks:
- Workspace cleanup before starting the build.
- Cloning the specific branch of the repository needed for the build process.
- Installation of dependencies required for testing.
- Execution of defined test suites with the results impacting the subsequent steps.
- Archiving artifacts and generating Allure reports for test analysis.
- Sending emails with test outcomes and report attachments to the relevant stakeholders.

## Custom Jenkins Methods
This Jenkins setup also features custom Groovy scripting for dynamic agent labeling, allowing the pipeline to select the appropriate build agent based on branch naming conventions.

## Continuous Learning
I am continuously refining my Jenkins skills, staying up-to-date with the latest plugins and best practices to improve build reliability and efficiency.

## Your Feedback
Any suggestions for improvement or contributions to the pipeline are highly appreciated, as collaborative development is key to achieving excellence in automation.

_Embrace the power of automation with Jenkins for streamlined and reliable software development._
